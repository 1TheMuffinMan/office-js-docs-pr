# Overview of Patterns and Practices for Office Add-ins

Office Add-ins PnP is a community driven effort that helps developers extend, build, and deploy solutions for the Office platform. The source is maintained on the [PnP-OfficeAddins GitHub repo](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-OfficeAddins) where anyone can participate. You can provide contributions to the samples, and documentation. Office Add-ins PnP is owned and coordinated by Office engineering teams, but the work is done by the community for the community. Office Add-ins PnP is a part of the broader [Microsoft 365 & SharePoint Ecosystem](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/blogs/microsoft-365-sharepoint-ecosystem-pnp-august-2020-update/).
