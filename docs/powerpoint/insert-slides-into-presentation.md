# Insert slides into a PowerPoint presentation

A PowerPoint add-in can insert slides from one presentation (in base64 format) into the current presentation by using PowerPoint's application-specific JavaScript library. You can control whether the inserted slides keep the formatting of the source presentation or the formatting of the target presentation.

## Insert slides with insertSlidesFromBase64

You can insert slides from another PowerPoint presentation into the current presentation with the [Presentation.insertSlidesFromBase64](/javascript/api/powerpoint/powerpoint.presentation#insertslidesfrombase64-base64file--options-) method.
