# Insert slides into a PowerPoint presentation

A PowerPoint add-in can insert slides from one presentation (in base64 format) into the current presentation by using PowerPoint's application-specific JavaScript library. You can control whether the inserted slides keep the formatting of the source presentation or the formatting of the target presentation.
